merge-review
-------------

Do a code review of the last six commits in this repository.
Keep track of what you did so you can demonstrate to someone
else the steps you took and what you were thinking/noting at
each point.

E.g., cjs uses `git log --stat -p` to show the log with the list of
files changed with each commit and the diffs for each file.

How long did your code review take? How difficult was it to do?
What issues, if any, did you spot?
